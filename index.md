## About Me

I am currently a **research engineer** at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/es/garcia-gilabert-javier). My research is centered on investigating added toxicity in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, utilizing decoder-only architectures for machine translation, enhancing the translation quality of low-resource languages, and improving the interpretability of large language models.
