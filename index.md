## About Me

I am currently a **research engineer** at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/es/garcia-gilabert-javier). My research is centered on investigating added toxicity in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, utilizing decoder-only architectures for machine translation, enhancing the translation quality of low-resource languages, and improving the interpretability of large language models.


## News
• **October 2024**: Our paper "Training and Fine-Tuning NMT Models for Low-Resource Languages using Apertium-Based Synthetic Corpora" was accepted by [WMT2024](https://www2.statmt.org/wmt24/pdf/2024.wmt-1.90.pdf). <br />
• **June 2024**: Release of  [Plume](https://huggingface.co/projecte-aina/Plume256k), an open multilingual LLM for Machine Translation. <br />
